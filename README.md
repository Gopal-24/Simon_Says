# üß† Simon Says Game

## üåü Overview

This repository features a web implementation of the classic memory game, *Simon Says* (also known as "Simon"). It tests the player's memory and concentration by requiring them to repeat increasingly long sequences of lights and sounds.

The game is built using foundational web technologies and provides an engaging, interactive experience directly in the browser.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

This project leverages the three core technologies of web development:

* **HTML5 (index.html):** Provides the structure for the game board (the colored buttons) and the display elements (score/level).
* **CSS3 (style.css):** Handles all visual styling, layout, and button animations (the "flash" effect).
* **JavaScript (app.js):** Implements the entire game logic, including:
    * Generating the sequence.
    * Handling button clicks.
    * Checking for correct input.
    * Managing the game state (start, level up, game over).

## ‚ú® Features

* *Classic Gameplay:* Faithful recreation of the Simon Says memory challenge.
* *Increasing Difficulty:* The sequence length increases with each successful level.
* *Visual Feedback:* Buttons "flash" to indicate the sequence pattern.
* *Sound Effects:* (Assumed) Use of audio to accompany the button flashes for a more immersive experience.
